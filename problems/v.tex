You might recognize the following monologue: \newline
\newline

\emph{
``Voila! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran 
cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. 
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now 
vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands 
vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding 
vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition! 
The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta held as a votive, not in vain, for the
value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add 
that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V.''

Write a program that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prepares a list of all words beginning with the letter `V' -- Each
		element of this list must of type \texttt{str}.
\item Calculates the number of words beginning with the letter `V' and words that
	don't, and their ratio.
\item Calculates the mean length of all words beginning with  a `V'.

\end {enumerate}

\subsection*{Useful functions and methods}
\begin{verbatim}
file.read
str.split
string.lower   # import the 'string' module first
