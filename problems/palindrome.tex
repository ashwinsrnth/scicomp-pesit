\section*{Highest Palindromic Product}

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from
the product of two 2-digit numbers is \texttt{9009 = 91 * 99}. Find the largest 
palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
\newline \\ Time the execution of your program using the \texttt{time} module. 
Here's how:
\begin{verbatim}
import time
t1 = time.clock()

# your code here:
# ---------------- #


# ---------------- #

t2 = time.clock()
print `Time for execution: ', t2 - t, ` seconds.'
\end{verbatim}
\textbf{Note: }\texttt{time.clock()} calculates the ``real time'' since the 
start of the program or process -- useful for benchmarking and optimization.

\section*{A Note on Optimization}
This problem has some scope for optimization -- a smart algorithm or special
functions can speed up the execution of the program many times over. If you have 
a fairly advanced programming knowledge, you can try and optimize.
\newline \\ Always remember, though: it's more important that your code is bug-free,
reusable and readable. More often than not, you will lose more time in
implementing optimized code than you will gain from running it.
\newline \\ \emph{``The first rule of program optimization: Don't do it. 
The second rule of program optimization (for experts only!): Don't do it yet.''}
